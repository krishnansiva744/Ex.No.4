## SCENARIO-BASED REPORT DEVELOPMENT UTILIZING DIVERSE PROMPTING TECHNIQUES â€“ Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Comparative Analysis Prompt and Prompt Size Limitations
### Aim:
To design a smart water management system using AI-powered sensors that detect leaks early, prevent water loss, and optimize maintenance in urban infrastructure. Preceding questions are used to guide AI in developing a relevant system plan.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Preceding Context Questions

- Before creating the system design, the following guiding questions are asked:

- Detection Methods â€“ What sensor types (pressure, flow, acoustic, IoT-enabled) are most effective for leak detection?

- Data Handling â€“ How will AI analyze sensor data in real-time to identify anomalies?

- Response Mechanism â€“ Should alerts be manual notifications or automated shut-off systems?

- Scalability â€“ How can this system expand from pilot areas to entire cities?

- Desired Outcome â€“ What measurable impacts are expected (reduced water loss, cost savings, faster repairs)?

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Smart Sensor System Plan (Tabular Format)

### Result:
Smart sensors integrated with AI can transform urban pipeline management by enabling real-time leak detection, predictive maintenance, and automated response systems. This leads to significant reductions in water wastage, repair costs, and downtime, making cities more sustainable and resilient.





# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
